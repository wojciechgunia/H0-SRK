<h2 align="left">About project:</h2>

###

<div align="left">
<p>The H0-SRK project is a program written in Python that allows you to handle rail traffic on a H0 scale model. The program was created for lovers of model railways who want to manage their model in the same way as on a real railway.</p>

<p>An additional functionality of the H0-SRK project is a wizard that allows the user to freely edit the track layout on the model. Thanks to this tool, you can create, modify and delete tracks, place semaphores, signals, turnouts and other elements of railway infrastructure. The wizard also offers the option of configuring track parameters, such as maximum speed on turnouts.</p>

<p>In order to provide an interactive user interface, the Qt library was used to create a graphical user interface (GUI). Qt provides a rich set of tools and components to create intuitive and attractive interfaces that are easy to use. Thanks to this, H0-SRK users can easily handle traffic on the layout and add, remove and adjust track elements.</p>
